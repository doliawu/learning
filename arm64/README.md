### Why ARM64:
Recently I was learning some linking & loading stuff, to ensure that I understand the whole picture, a basic understanding of assembly is required. And the reason why ARM64 is chosen is simple because the device on my hand happen to be ARM64 based.

I read multiple tutorials but finally find that the official tutorial provided on ARM's website is the most helpful one: 
[Learn the architecture: AArch64 Instruction Set Architecture
](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102374/latest/). It gives a basic understanding of registers and instructions, and also shows what's next after reading through this tutorial.
